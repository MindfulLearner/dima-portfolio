## 🛠️ Try My No-Login GitHub PR Contribution System

If you'd like to experience a GitHub Pull Request (PR) contribution flow **without logging in**, and earn the **Contributor Pair Badge** (if you haven't already), just follow these steps:

1. Visit: [https://dima-portfolio.vercel.app/](https://dima-portfolio.vercel.app/)
   *(Desktop only)*
2. Choose a terminal from the interface.
3. Type the following command, replacing the email with the one linked to your GitHub account:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "YourGithubEmail@example.com"
   ```
4. Review the incoming data. A PR will be proposed based on your input — you're free to accept or ignore it.
5. Wait for the confirmation message.
6. Leave honest feedback — either by commenting on the PR or opening a new issue.

🌟 If you enjoyed the experience, feel free to star the repository — it really helps!
